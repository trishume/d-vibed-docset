# Dash Vibed

A docset for Vibe.d for Dash and Zeal

Check out the [releases](https://github.com/trishume/d-vibed-docset/releases) section for a zipped pre-generated docset.

## Generating

You can generate it yourself, but I warn you that it takes a while to download the website.
```sh
bundle install
rake download
rake gen
```
